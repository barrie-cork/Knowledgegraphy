The audit will consider the number and configuration of existing health boards and other agencies and the scope for rationalisation.
2001,Strategy,Department of Health and Children,Quality_and_Fairness_A_Health_System_for_You_2001,planned_action:hospital_capacity,Acute hospital care will be developed and reformed through the creation of 3,000 extra hospital beds for public patients and a range of other measures.
2001,Strategy,Department of Health and Children,Quality_and_Fairness_A_Health_System_for_You_2001,planned_action:hospital_capacity,No public patient will wait longer than 3 months from the date of referral for the scheduling of treatment.
2001,Strategy,Department of Health and Children,Quality_and_Fairness_A_Health_System_for_You_2001,planned_action:hospital_capacity,Additional acute hospital beds will be provided for public patients • Over the next ten years a total of 3,000 acute beds will be added to the system. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland. The study of acute hospital bed requirements concluded that a figure of between 2,800 and 4,300 beds would be required over the period to 2011. The Government has decided to provide for a total of 3,000 beds, taking account of investment in non-acute facilities and community support services, increased use of day beds and a number of other factors • 650 of the extra beds will be provided by the end of 2002, of which 450 will be in the public sector, thus providing extra capacity for the treatment of public patients on waiting lists. The private hospital sector will be contracted to provide 200 beds, all for treatment of public patients on waiting lists.
2001,Strategy,Department of Health and Children,Quality_and_Fairness_A_Health_System_for_You_2001,planned_action:funding,A strategic partnership with private hospital providers will be developed The Government is committed to exploring fully the scope for the private sector to provide additional capacity. Accordingly, the extra beds in the period to 2011 will be provided by a combination of public and private providers. To achieve this, a strategic partnership will be developed with the private hospital sector to provide more treatment for public patients. This will be progressed by setting up a Forum under the aegis of the new National Hospitals Agency (described below) involving the public and private sectors and insurers. The key objective is to provide the required extra capacity, whether this is in the public or private hospital sector.
2001,Strategy,Department of Health and Children,Quality_and_Fairness_A_Health_System_for_You_2001,planned_action:governance,A National Hospitals Agency will be established This Strategy commits the Government to a significant increase in the number of hospital beds over the next ten years. An objective, evidence-based means is required to determine the specialties in which these extra beds will be provided and their location around the country. Key decisions will need to be taken about the future configuration of existing hospitals. Co-operation between hospitals needs to be reinforced so that a fully integrated hospital system is achieved. In addition, specialist advice is regularly required on the priority that should be attached to the development of individual specialties and services in acute hospitals throughout the country. An independent agency is required which can provide expert, objective advice on these matters as they arise. A National Hospitals Agency will be established on a statutory basis under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children. Its staff will have or draw upon appropriate expertise and specialist knowledge to carry out its tasks.
2001,Strategy,Department of Health and Children,Quality_and_Fairness_A_Health_System_for_You_2001,planned_action:funding,A comprehensive set of actions will taken to reduce waiting times for public patients, including the establishment of a new ear-marked Treatment Purchase Fund A new focus will be placed on waiting times. The target is that by the end of 2004, all public patients will be scheduled to commence treatment within a maximum of three months of referral from an out-patient department.
2001,Strategy,Department of Health and Children,Quality_and_Fairness_A_Health_System_for_You_2001,planned_action:hospital_capacity,The target improvements in waiting times will be achieved by: • a major expansion in acute bed capacity, as described above, together with reform of primary care, strengthening of Accident and Emergency services and provision of additional non-acute places
2001,Strategy,Department of Health and Children,Quality_and_Fairness_A_Health_System_for_You_2001,planned_action:funding,an ear-marked Treatment Purchase Fund which will be used to purchase treatment from private hospitals in Ireland, and from international providers. It may also make use of any capacity within public hospitals to arrange treatments for patients.
2001,Strategy,Department of Health and Children,Quality_and_Fairness_A_Health_System_for_You_2001,planned_action:governance,A National Treatment Purchase Team appointed by the Minister for Health and Children will manage the new Treatment Purchase Fund, working closely with the health boards. The team will commence its work immediately, in parallel with other reforms below. It will work in partnership with the health boards, hospitals and consultants to ensure that waiting times for public patients are reduced as quickly as possible. The National Treatment Purchase Team will enter into immediate discussions with relevant hospitals and consultants to make streamlined arrangements to ensure that patients are offered the treatment they need. It is essential for the successful operation of the scheme that management procedures are highly efficient and that there is no avoidable delay in sourcing and referral of patients to the treatment needed.
2001,Strategy,Department of Health and Children,Quality_and_Fairness_A_Health_System_for_You_2001,planned_action:governance,Management and organisation of waiting lists will be reformed The National Hospitals Agency, working with the health boards and ERHA, will, in consultation with relevant professional bodies, lead the development of guidelines for referral and prioritisation of patients within and between specialties, particularly those where there are lengthy waiting times. The guidelines will assist general practitioners in making referrals in keeping with best clinical practice and consultants in managing waiting lists/times.

The model described sets out the principles for progress; it does not purport to address all of the detailed issues that will need to be worked through in the implementation phases. This will require consultation on an ongoing basis with all the relevant stakeholders. The model will be implemented on a phased basis over a two to ten-year timeframe. A National Primary Care Task Force will be established A small full-time task force will be established to take responsibility for driving the implementation of the changes and developments set out in the model. The task force will be inter-disciplinary and will report to a wider representative Steering Group which will be chaired by the Department of Health and Children and include representation from health boards, primary care professional groups, unions, and other relevant stakeholders.

Implementation projects will be put in place Locations for implementation projects will be chosen in each health board region for the development of primary care teams over the next two to four years (40-60 teams nationally). The concentration in the initial stages will be in locations where there is already evidence of successful partnership and co-operation between general practice and health board services. Evaluation of these implementation projects will inform the further phased development of teams in remaining parts of the country which will lead to the development of 400-600 teams to cover approximately two-thirds of the population by 2011. Investment will be made in extension of GP co-operatives and other specific national initiatives to complement the primary care model In the short-term, GP co-operatives will be established on a national basis so that effective out-of-hours services are available in all parts of the country. In addition, other specific developments on a national basis will include: • general increases in personnel needed for primary care teams and wider networks leading to improved out of-hours services • new physical infrastructure and equipment • improvements in information and communications technology

2001,Strategy,Department of Health and Children,Primary_Care_A_New_Direction_2001,planned_action:community_healthcare,Primary care centres: Taking an initial 40 to 60 implementation projects, and allowing for the fact that the selection of locations will be guided by the availability of good infrastructure where it exists, it can be expected that a capital outlay of approximately £100 million (€127M) will be required during the initial five-year implementation phase. In the longer term, on the assumption that between 400 and 600 core primary care teams will be required for two-thirds implementation in 2011, the capital investment would be in the order of £1,000 million (€1,270M) at current prices. The National Development Plan may provide some of this investment. Staffing: the total cost of the implementation projects would amount to £48 million (€61M).6 Taking into account estimates of existing expenditure, some £25-30 million (€32-38M) additional investment on human resources will be required over the next five years. Assuming two-thirds implementation (400-600 teams) of the model over the next ten years, approximately an additional 500 GPs and 2,000 nurses/midwives will be required, with similar large increases in health and social care professionals, administrative staff, home helps and health care assistants in order to provide in the range of 400-600 teams. Co-operatives: it is expected that a number of teams would come together to provide out-of-hours coverage for population groups. To provide the infrastructure required for the operation of the enhanced 24-hour service an annual cost in the region of £25 million (€32M) is estimated.

2001,Review,Comhairle na nOspidal,Committee_on_AE_Services_2002,recommendation.health_service_system,The Committee recommends that a three-tiered Emergency Department system be adopted nationally. Within this system, the three tiers would be as follows: 1. Regional Emergency Departments Such departments would be located in major regional hospitals and would serve a catchment population of about 250,000. Each of these hospitals would function as the major trauma receiving hospital for the region, provide a referral service for local general hospitals, provide advice and stabilisation for complex cases referred from general hospitals and other emergency services and participate in the regional retrieval service. The Regional Emergency Department would provide resuscitation, stabilisation and initial treatment for all emergencies. They would be staffed by a number of consultants in emergency medicine (one of whom should have a special interest in paediatric emergency medicine) and a multi-professional team. Each Regional Emergency Department would be led by a Director who would be one of the consultants in emergency medicine. 2. Hospital Emergency Departments with access to some specialist surgical and medical services on-site Such departments would be linked to the Regional Emergency Department for trauma services, subspecialty services and certain diagnostic services. Each would have access to regional retrieval services. Hospitals with these Emergency Departments would be able to manage most emergencies, including stabilisation and assisted ventilation. They would have an on-site ability to provide a team response and would be staffed by 1-2 consultants in emergency medicine and a multi-professional team. One of the consultants would function as Head of the Hospital Emergency Department. 3. Hospital Emergency Departments with access to specialist services off-site Each of these Hospital Emergency Departments would provide nurse-led services for minor illness and injury together with 24-hour access to medical staff on-site and resuscitation and limited stabilisation prior to referral to the Regional Emergency Department (if necessary). Patients arriving at these Hospital Emergency Departments would have 24-hour access to medical staff. A consultant on the hospital staff would function as the lead clinician in, and have responsibility for, the organisation and co-ordination of the Hospital Emergency Department. There would be access to Consultants in Emergency Medicine in the Regional Emergency Department for support, development and training purposes.

Each Regional Emergency Department would be led by a Director who would be one of the consultants in emergency medicine Staffing the Hospital Emergency Services The committee recommends the following clinical management structure for hospital emergency services. Regional Co-ordinator of Emergency Services: Each health board should have a Regional Co-ordinator of Emergency Services who would advise the health board on the operation and organisation of emergency services and would be responsible for the development and implementation of agreed protocols across the regional emergency service including each hospital in the health board area. The Regional Emergency Service Co-ordinator would also function as the Director of the Regional Emergency Department where heshe would be based. Director of the Regional Emergency Department: Each Regional Emergency Department would be led by a Director who would be one of the Consultants in Emergency Medicine. The post could rotate between different consultants in the Emergency Department or be filled from a competitive appointment process. It is envisaged that the Director of the Regional Emergency Department would have overall clinical and administrative responsibility for the Emergency Department. All staff in the department would be responsible to the Director on operational matters. Consultants in Emergency Medicine: Consultants in Emergency Medicine treat patients of all ages with emergency medical problems and injuries, covering the breadth of medicine. They deal with episodic and emergency care, referring longer-term acute care, elective procedures and the follow-up of chronic problems to others. The large majority of the sessional commitment of a Consultant in Emergency Medicine should be to clinical as distinct from administrative duties or legal work. His or her clinical duties centre on the stabilisation of patients in order to ensure that all life-threatening causes of illness and injury are investigated. The Consultant in Emergency Medicine is responsible for ensuring that the patient is admitted to the most appropriate service to further explore the problem if such is required. Depending on the number of consultant posts in Emergency Medicine in a service, different rosters and cover arrangements will apply. All Consultants in Emergency Medicine, other than the Regional Directors, should have a majority clinical commitment.
2001,Review,Comhairle na nOspidal,Committee_on_AE_Services_2002,issue:staffing,The Committee notes that 75 of patients attend Emergency Departments between the hours of 8am and 8pm. Having regard to the recommendations of the Forum on Medical Manpower, the Hanly Report and the remit of the National Taskforce on Medical Staffing the committees recommendations aim to put in place structures which facilitate the onsite presence of Consultants in Emergency Medicine in Regional Emergency Departments between the hours of 8am and 8pm, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. The Committee is aware of the industrial relations issues which will need to be resolved to support some of these recommendations Consultants in Emergency Medicine play a key clinical and managerial role in Emergency Departments. The appointment of additional consultants should contribute to improvements in patient care and the flow of patients through the Emergency Department. However, appointing additional Consultants in Emergency Medicine without ensuring changes in the organisation of Emergency Departments and hospital emergency care will have limited impact. In summary, staffing of the Hospital Emergency Service will involve:  Consultants in Emergency Medicine where appropriate (including one with a special interest in paediatric emergency medicine)  Consultants in Medicine, Surgery and Paediatrics participating in the clinical governance of the Hospital Emergency Service. Increases in consultant staffing or 105 revised sessional commitments may be required. This particularly applies to smaller hospitals with low attendances in the Emergency Department.  NCHDs in emergency medicine and in a number of other specialties  ideally in accredited training positions  Nursing staff  some of whom may be Advanced Nurse Practitioners (Emergency)  Administrative and clerical staff  including a Manager for the Hospital Emergency Service  Essential support staff

2001,Review,Comhairle na nOspidal,Committee_on_AE_Services_2002,recommendation.staffing,The Committee took into account the plan for the development of emergency services in the region presented by the MWHB and recommends that a Regional Emergency Service be established in the Mid-Western area. The Director of the Regional Emergency Department, who would also be the Regional Co-ordinator, would be based in the Regional Emergency Department at the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick, formerly known as Limerick Regional. The Committee recommends that 2 additional posts of Consultant in Emergency Medicine be approved for the Mid-Western Regional Emergency Department  based in Mid-Western Regional Hopsital. This would lead - initially - to a total of 3 posts with sessional commitments to Ennis, Nenagh and St. Johns hospitals. The Committee also recommends that in the event of:  The putting in place of the internal Emergency Department processes and systems detailed in this report  The development of Hospital Emergency Services and a Regional Emergency Service along the lines set out in this report  Resolution of a number of industrial relations issues which would enable on-site rostering of consultants at busy times in the Emergency Department that 2 additional posts of Consultant in Emergency Medicine be approved for the Mid Western Emergency Service  each post to be based in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick - contributing to a total of 5 posts in the Mid-Western region.
2001,Review,Comhairle na nOspidal,Committee_on_AE_Services_2002,recommendation.staffing,he implementation of the first phase will involve the creation of 34 permanent posts of Consultant in Emergency Medicine nationally  5 more than the 29 detailed in the Winter Initiative.

The current model of referrals to the AMU and ASAU should be reviewed and realigned with national guidance to re-introduce access for GPs to the assessment maintain referrals from the ED following assessment by the ED team. Staffing in the ED, AMU and ASAU will be required to implement this recommendation. A range of ED avoidance measure have been identified in the recommendations section of this document including consultant assisted triage in the ED, documentation of ED avoidance pathways for NCHDs, improving OPD access and providing AMU access for GPs. All of these measures could help with increasing demand… ➢ Patient Flow at Post-Admission A number of measures have been identified to improve timely discharge including speciality cohorting on wards, Increased nursing involvement in ward rounds & care planning, implementation of criteria led discharging for common conditions, streamlining ward rounds and increasing HSCP staffing on wards. Implementation of some of these measures could be considered immediately, others such as speciality cohorting will require reduced inpatient occupancy rates through additional bed capacity to be successful. Renewed measures to reduce DTOCs such as focus on discharge planning from admission and streamlined access to rehab beds could help to reduce bed days lost due to DTOCs... For information: Hospital capacity (including inpatient bed capacity, ED capacity and surge capacity) Recommendation/considerations: As described in the findings there is a requirement for an 302 additional inpatient beds and 63 day beds. There are a number of options for how this additional capacity could be configured including additional bed capacity on the UHL site, a standalone model 3 hospital, an elective only facility or a combination of the above. We would recommend a detailed options appraisal to arrive at the option that would deliver maximal benefits. There are a set of recommendations outlined in this document that could deliver benefits in terms of admission avoidance and improved egress. The total quantum of bed savings that could be realised from these benefits is estimated to be 30 beds. This means that there remains a large gap between capacity and demand even if significant efficiencies can be gained ➢ Patient Flow at Post-Admission Bed capacity needs to be increased to meet demand. To address the immediate demand of circa 87 beds would be required to bring the occupancy rate to 80%. By 2036 202 additional beds are required and an additional 100 replacement beds, a total of 302 inpatient beds. There are a number of options for how these beds could be configured including additional beds, a detailed options appraisal is required to arrive at the most appropriate solution Governance Recommendation/considerations: The implementation plan should therefore be accompanied by a structured and robust project and change management plan that is adequately resourced and funded, as the staff across the hospital are already working in high pressure and full-time roles so new change resources will be required to support it. We would recommend that a formal programme structure be established to manage the implementation plan with dedicated project management and project support resources including a dedicated PM with acute hospital operations experience and clinical leadership involvement. We would also recommend a more detailed review of staffing, leadership & culture to be undertaken and for any recommendations arising from this review to be incorporated into the overall implementation plan. It would also be beneficial to seek patient feedback and to better understand the patient experience and to identify the key challenges from the perspective of the patient. ➢ Leadership & Governance It is recommended that the role of the Head of Operational Service for the UHL site which has been recently recruited be embedded into the governance structure to take on additional operational responsibility from the Directorates and allow for them to play more of a strategic role. It is also recommended that the CDs are supported to have additional capacity through a strengthened and formalised ACD role and provision of admin support for them in their role. The reporting and escalation requirements from the Directorates need to be clarified and clearly communicated to reduce duplication of escalation and drive autonomy at Directorate level. The culture of ULHG is mixed with evident staff fatigue following a difficult number of years. It is recommended that a targeted programme of staff engagement (such as that being initiated by the HR Director) strive to address staff issues or concerns where this is possible and also to celebrate successes and share future development plans with staff. The development of a transformation office including Change and PMO would further support the Strategy function with the implementation of key strategic initiatives. Finally, the QPS department has developed a detailed future org structure which requires funding for key posts. Given the strong role this department plays in driving quality and patient safety it is recommended that funding be provided for these posts. For information: Community healthcare (including GPs, and nursing homes) Recommendation/considerations: ➢ Integrated Community and Hospital Services The impact of enhanced community services on inpatient admissions has not been quantified as the proposed impact of the measures is not yet clear nor is the timeline for these benefits to be seen. To date implementation of initiatives such as the ICPOP hubs has not been correlated with a reduction in ED attendances. There are challenges nationally in accessing primary care and solutions to address this at a national level would be beneficial. In addition, ramping up and increasing throughput in existing funded community services would be useful. It would also be beneficial to evaluate the impact of increased community services on demand for acute services. For information: Staffing (including workforce planning, recruitment and retention) Recommendation/considerations: ➢ Patient Flow at Pre-Admission …ED staffing needs to be increased to manage the increased demand, particularly Consultants and NCHDs. ➢ Patient Flow at Post-Admission … Similar to the ED, additional staffing is required on the wards particularly HSCP staffing and bed management resources. For information: Funding Not identified Other Recommendation/considerations: ➢ Improve technology to improve efficiency & quality of care While this is largely outside of the control of ULHG and Midwest Community Healthcare locally, it is recommended that the eHealth systems across the hospital and CHO are upgraded to a fit-for-purpose single electronic healthcare record to improve visibility, efficiency and quality of care as has been demonstrated in numerous studies internationally. The lack of a single patient record is having significant impacts on patient flow. Interim measures as also recommended such as implementation of order comms and upgrading the ICT infrastructure. For information: Impact Estimated impact: Adjustments based on recommendations • • Review AMU pathway: opportunity to reduce the emergency admissions by 10% (2,625), these admissions are likely to be associated with a shorter ALOS (1 day) equating to a potential bed saving of 8 beds • Admission avoidance measures: 30% of emergency admissions have an ALOS of 1 day. Implementation of admission avoidance measures could have an impact on these admissions. Assuming a further 50% of these 1 day admissions could be prevented there would be an additional saving of 8 beds. • Timely discharges: Implementation of the measures described in this document to improve timeliness of discharges could be expected to reduce the ALOS by 3 hours. If this was achieved it would save 10 beds • DTOCs: Earlier and improved discharge planning and use of standardised processes for accessing step down and rehab beds could reduce the ALOS of medically discharged DTOCs. If there was a reduction by 2 days from 15 days to 13 days this would save 4 beds per year.

2002,Review,Deloitte,ULHG_Patient_Flow_Report_2022,issue:hospital_capacity,By 2036 202 additional beds are required and an additional 100 replacement beds, a total of 302 inpatient beds. There are a number of options for how these beds could be configured including additional beds, a detailed options appraisal is required to arrive at the most appropriate solution
2002,Review,Deloitte,ULHG_Patient_Flow_Report_2022,recommendation.goverance,The implementation plan should therefore be accompanied by a structured and robust project and change management plan that is adequately resourced and funded, as the staff across the hospital are already working in high pressure and full-time roles so new change resources will be required to support it. We would recommend that a formal programme structure be established to manage the implementation plan with dedicated project management and project support resources including a dedicated PM with acute hospital operations experience and clinical leadership involvement. We would also recommend a more detailed review of staffing, leadership & culture to be undertaken and for any recommendations arising from this review to be incorporated into the overall implementation plan. It would also be beneficial to seek patient feedback and to better understand the patient experience and to identify the key challenges from the perspective of the patient.
2002,Review,Deloitte,ULHG_Patient_Flow_Report_2022,recommendation.goverance,Leadership & Governance It is recommended that the role of the Head of Operational Service for the UHL site which has been recently recruited be embedded into the governance structure to take on additional operational responsibility from the Directorates and allow for them to play more of a strategic role. It is also recommended that the CDs are supported to have additional capacity through a strengthened and formalised ACD role and provision of admin support for them in their role. The reporting and escalation requirements from the Directorates need to be clarified and clearly communicated to reduce duplication of escalation and drive autonomy at Directorate level. The culture of ULHG is mixed with evident staff fatigue following a difficult number of years. It is recommended that a targeted programme of staff engagement (such as that being initiated by the HR Director) strive to address staff issues or concerns where this is possible and also to celebrate successes and share future development plans with staff. The development of a transformation office including Change and PMO would further support the Strategy function with the implementation of key strategic initiatives. Finally, the QPS department has developed a detailed future org structure which requires funding for key posts. Given the strong role this department plays in driving quality and patient safety it is recommended that funding be provided for these posts.
